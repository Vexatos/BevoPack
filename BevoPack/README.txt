======
This is the BevoPack esspecially made for BevoLJ, adding "Bevonian English". Since many mods do not use the Vanilla Localization handling,
some mods can't be translated properly.
If you want to have the language added to Buildcraft, you would have to take the 
lang/buildcraft/en_BV.properties and place it in the Buildcraft.jar you are using, right at the same place.
