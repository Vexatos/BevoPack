This is the BevoPack esspecially made for BevoLJ, adding "Bevonian English". Since many mods do not use the Vanilla Localization handling,
some of them can't be translated properly.
If you want to have the language added to GregTech, you would have to take the 
config/GregTech/GregTech.lang file and place it inside your instance's GregTech config folder.
